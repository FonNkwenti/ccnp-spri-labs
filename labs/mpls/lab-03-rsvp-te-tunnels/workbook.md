## 1. Concepts & Skills Covered

**Exam Objective:** 4.1.e — RSVP-TE tunnels (CCNP SPRI 300-510)

RSVP-TE (Resource Reservation Protocol — Traffic Engineering) lets a service provider signal explicit label-switched paths through the MPLS core while simultaneously reserving bandwidth along each hop. This lab builds directly on the LDP and BGP-free core established in labs 00–02, adding a TE control plane that lets the operator steer traffic away from the default CSPF-chosen path and onto specific network segments.

### MPLS Traffic Engineering Architecture

MPLS TE has four distinct components that must all be in place before a tunnel can signal:

**1. TE topology database (TED)** — IS-IS (or OSPF) floods TE-extended LSAs that carry per-link bandwidth, maximum reservable bandwidth, and TE metric. Every TE-enabled router builds a complete view of the core topology from these extensions. The TED is separate from the regular IS-IS routing table; a router can be in the IS-IS RIB but invisible to TE if it hasn't enabled TE flooding.

**2. CSPF (Constrained Shortest Path First)** — runs on the tunnel headend only. Reads the TED, applies constraints (bandwidth, explicit path, affinity), and selects the path for the tunnel. CSPF prunes any link where available bandwidth < requested bandwidth before running Dijkstra.

**3. RSVP signaling** — the headend sends PATH messages hop-by-hop toward the tail; each transit LSR checks bandwidth admission and forwards the PATH. The tail sends RESV messages back toward the headend, creating the label reservation. No RESV = no tunnel.

**4. Forwarding** — after a successful RESV, the headend installs a label-stack entry for the tunnel. Traffic steered into the tunnel is forwarded as if on a normal LDP LSP, but following the RSVP-reserved path rather than the IGP best path.

```
 Headend            Transit            Tail
  (PE1)              (P1)              (PE2)
    │     PATH ──────►│     PATH ──────►│
    │                 │  (admission ok) │
    │◄──── RESV ──────│◄──── RESV ──────│
    │ (label stacked) │ (label swapped) │
```

All four components must be active on every hop; a single missing piece silently breaks the tunnel.

### IS-IS TE Extensions

To participate in TE topology flooding, every core router needs two additions under `router isis`:

- `mpls traffic-eng level-2` — instructs IS-IS to originate Extended IS Reachability (TLV 22) sub-TLVs carrying TE attributes (link bandwidth, max reservable BW, TE metric). Without this, the router is invisible to CSPF on other nodes even though it appears in the normal IS-IS RIB.
- `mpls traffic-eng router-id Loopback0` — sets the stable TE router ID (must match the loopback used for RSVP SENDER_TEMPLATE). This must be the same loopback as the LDP router-id.

After adding these, verify with `show mpls traffic-eng topology` on any core router — every TE-enabled node and every TE-enabled link appears with bandwidth attributes.

### RSVP Bandwidth and Admission Control

`ip rsvp bandwidth <total-kbps> <max-flow-kbps>` on an interface does two things:
1. Enables RSVP on the interface (required — RSVP is disabled by default)
2. Sets the reservable bandwidth pool for admission control

CSPF reads the TED's "available bandwidth" field (total - already reserved) when selecting paths. If a link has `ip rsvp bandwidth 10` (10 kbps) but a tunnel requests 10,000 kbps (10 Mbps), CSPF eliminates that link from consideration. This is admission control working correctly — it prevents over-subscription.

The `show mpls traffic-eng topology` output shows both configured and available bandwidth per link, making it the definitive diagnostic command for bandwidth-related CSPF failures.

### RSVP-TE Explicit Paths

Dynamic CSPF picks the best path automatically. Explicit paths override CSPF to force specific transit nodes:

```
ip explicit-path name PE1-via-P2 enable
 next-address loose 10.0.0.3     ! P2 loopback — traverse P2
 next-address loose 10.0.0.4     ! PE2 loopback — end here
```

`loose` means "reach this address via any available path from the current position." `strict` (default, no keyword) means "the next address must be a directly connected neighbor" — which requires the actual interface IP, not the loopback.

Explicit paths are powerful for traffic engineering:
- Pin specific traffic classes to specific physical links for capacity sharing
- Keep high-priority flows off congested paths
- Test alternate paths without disrupting primary traffic

### CSPF Affinity Constraints (Link Coloring)

Affinity is a 32-bit bitmask that CSPF uses to filter which links are eligible for a tunnel's path — think of it as "link coloring." Every physical interface has an **attribute flag** (default `0x00000000`); every tunnel has an **affinity value** and a **mask**. CSPF only considers a link if:

```
(link_attribute_flags & affinity_mask) == (tunnel_affinity & affinity_mask)
```

Configure link colors on physical interfaces:

```
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 mpls traffic-eng attribute-flags 0x1    ! set bit 0 — "gold" link
```

Configure affinity constraints on a tunnel:

```
interface Tunnel10
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng affinity 0x1 mask 0x1   ! require bit 0 set
```

With this constraint, CSPF only selects links that have attribute bit 0 set. Any link with `attribute-flags 0x0` (the default) is pruned before Dijkstra runs — exactly like a link with insufficient bandwidth. The tunnel goes down with `Path: not valid` if no path through colored links exists.

**Default behavior (no affinity configured):** Both tunnel affinity and mask default to `0x0/0xFFFF`. This matches every link (all links have attribute 0x0 by default), so CSPF considers all links — the expected behavior when affinity is not in use.

**Explicit paths bypass affinity:** When a tunnel uses `path-option N explicit`, CSPF validates the named waypoints but does not apply affinity filtering to intermediate hops. Affinity constraints only apply to dynamic CSPF path selection.

**Exam tip:** A tunnel that is `Oper: down` with `Path: not valid` and a full TE topology almost always points to either a bandwidth admission failure, a missing explicit path reference, or an affinity mismatch. Check `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels <TunnelN>` for the signalled affinity value and compare against `show mpls traffic-eng link-management interfaces` for per-link attribute flags.

### Traffic Steering with Autoroute

By default, a TE tunnel is a forwarding device but nothing points traffic into it. `tunnel mpls traffic-eng autoroute announce` installs the tunnel's destination prefix (PE2 loopback) into IS-IS as if the tunnel were an IS-IS adjacency, with the tunnel's metric used as the IS-IS route cost. After this, `show ip route 10.0.0.4` on PE1 shows `via Tunnel10` as the outgoing interface. `traceroute 10.0.0.4` will show the first physical hop on the tunnel path with an `[MPLS: Label]` annotation — the tunnel interface itself is transparent to traceroute, but the label confirms the packet was forwarded through the RSVP-TE LSP.

## 2. Topology & Scenario

**Scenario:** The SP core (AS 65100) has been running LDP-based forwarding since lab-00. Operations wants to add RSVP-TE tunnels so they can pin high-value customer traffic to specific paths independent of the default IGP route. You are tasked with enabling the TE control plane on all four core routers, verifying the TE topology database, and building two tunnels from PE1 to PE2: one with dynamic CSPF path selection, and a second that explicitly forces transit through P2.

## 4. Base Configuration

The following is **pre-loaded** via `setup_lab.py`:

**IS pre-loaded:**
- Hostnames
- Interface IP addressing (all routed links and loopbacks)
- `no ip domain-lookup`
- IS-IS L2 adjacencies (`router isis CORE`, area 49.0001, level-2-only, `metric-style wide`, loopback passive)
- MPLS LDP on all core-facing interfaces (`mpls ip`, `mpls mtu override 1508`, `mpls ldp router-id Loopback0 force`)
- iBGP PE1↔PE2 with `send-label` and `next-hop-self` (lab-02 solution state)
- eBGP PE1↔CE1 and PE2↔CE2 with customer prefix advertisements (lab-02 solution state)

- MPLS TE on core-facing interfaces (`mpls traffic-eng tunnels` per interface)
- IS-IS TE flooding extensions (`mpls traffic-eng level-2`, `mpls traffic-eng router-id`)
- RSVP reservable bandwidth on core interfaces
- TE tunnel interfaces (Tunnel10 dynamic, Tunnel20 explicit)
- Explicit path definitions
- Autoroute announce on Tunnel10
- Explicit path (PE1-via-P2) for Tunnel20

---

## 5. Lab Challenge: Core Implementation

### Task 1: Enable MPLS Traffic Engineering Globally

- Enable MPLS TE on all four core routers (PE1, P1, P2, PE2) at the global configuration level.
- Enable MPLS TE on every core-facing interface of each core router: PE1 Gi0/1 and Gi0/2; P1 Gi0/0, Gi0/1, and Gi0/2; P2 Gi0/0, Gi0/1, and Gi0/2; PE2 Gi0/1 and Gi0/2. Customer-facing interfaces (PE1 Gi0/0, PE2 Gi0/0) do not need TE.

**Verification:** `show mpls interfaces detail` on each core router must show `LSP Tunnel labeling enabled` on each core-facing interface where TE was applied.

> **Note:** `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels` returns **no output at this stage** — that is correct. No tunnel interfaces exist yet (they are created in Tasks 4 and 5). An empty result means the command accepted successfully; an error (`% Invalid input`) would indicate TE is not globally enabled.

---

### Task 2: Enable IS-IS Traffic Engineering Extensions

- On each core router (PE1, P1, P2, PE2), configure the router process to originate TE sub-TLVs by enabling TE flooding for level-2 and specifying Loopback0 as the TE router ID.

**Verification:** `show mpls traffic-eng topology` on PE1 must list all four core routers (PE1, P1, P2, PE2) as TE nodes. Each node entry must include link bandwidth attributes for every connected core interface. If any router is absent from the topology output, its IS-IS TE extensions are not configured.

---

### Task 3: Enable RSVP Bandwidth Reservations on Core Links

- On every core-facing interface of PE1, P1, P2, and PE2 (all five links: L2, L3, L4, L5, L6 — both endpoints of each link), configure 100 Mbps total reservable bandwidth and 100 Mbps maximum per-flow bandwidth.

**Verification:** `show ip rsvp interface` on each core router must show all core-facing interfaces listed with 100,000 kbps allocated and 100,000 kbps maximum per-flow. An interface not listed here has no RSVP — PATH messages traversing it will not generate RESV responses.

---

### Task 4: Build Tunnel10 with Dynamic CSPF Path and Autoroute

All configuration for this task is on **PE1 only**. The transit routers (P1, P2) and the tail (PE2) need no tunnel interface — they were fully prepared in Tasks 1–3. When the tunnel is signalled, PE1 sends an RSVP PATH message hop-by-hop toward PE2; each transit router forwards it and reserves bandwidth; PE2 receives it and automatically sends a RESV back to PE1. No manual intervention is needed on PE2 to accept the tunnel.

- On PE1, create a tunnel interface numbered 10.
- Set the tunnel destination to PE2's loopback address.
- Use IP unnumbered from Loopback0 — no dedicated /30 is needed for each tunnel.
- Set the tunnel mode to MPLS TE.
- Request 10 Mbps of bandwidth. CSPF reads this value during path computation and prunes any link that cannot satisfy it.
- Set the setup priority and hold priority both to 1. Priority controls RSVP-TE preemption: a new tunnel whose setup priority is numerically lower than an existing tunnel's hold priority can tear down that tunnel to claim its bandwidth. The range is 0 (highest) to 7 (lowest); the default is 7/7. Setting both to 1 makes this a high-priority tunnel that can preempt most others and is itself only displaced by a tunnel with setup priority 0.
- Attach a single dynamic path-option — CSPF selects the route automatically based on the TE topology database.
- Enable autoroute announce so IS-IS installs PE2's loopback reachability through the tunnel rather than via the physical core link.

> **Context help:** All RSVP-TE tunnel parameters — bandwidth, path-option, autoroute, priority — live under the `tunnel mpls traffic-eng` command tree, not `mpls traffic-eng`. From inside a tunnel interface, try `tunnel mpls traffic-eng ?` to explore the available sub-commands.

**Verification:** `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels tunnel10` must show `Admin: up  Oper: up`. `show ip route 10.0.0.4` on PE1 must show the tunnel interface as the outgoing interface.

---

### Task 5: Build Tunnel20 with an Explicit Path via P2

Explicit paths let you override CSPF and pin an RSVP-TE tunnel to a specific set of transit nodes. They are named path definitions created in global configuration and then referenced by name inside the tunnel interface.

- On PE1, define a named explicit path called `PE1-via-P2` that forces transit through P2's loopback before reaching PE2's loopback. Use loose next-address hops — CSPF resolves the physical route between each waypoint automatically.
- Create a tunnel interface numbered 20, destined for PE2's loopback.
- Use the same IP unnumbered, tunnel mode, bandwidth, and priority settings as Tunnel10.
- Attach the explicit path as the sole path-option. There is no dynamic fallback — if P2 or its links become unavailable, Tunnel20 goes down by design.
- Do not add autoroute announce. Tunnel10 already handles reachability to PE2; Tunnel20 is reserved for explicit traffic steering.

> **Context help:** Explicit path definitions use `ip explicit-path name <name> enable` followed by `next-address` sub-commands. This is a **global config** command — enter it at `(config)#`, not inside the tunnel interface. Use `next-address ?` (before typing the address) to see the available hop-type keywords — they precede the IP address, not follow it.

**Verification:** `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels Tunnel20` must show `Oper: up` and the explicit path name in use. The ERO hops in the same output must include P2's address, confirming the path transits through P2 rather than P1.

---

### Task 6: Compare Tunnel10 and Tunnel20 Paths

- From PE1, run `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels` to display both tunnels side by side. Note which physical path each tunnel uses (one should go via P1, the other via P2 — they represent two disjoint paths through the diamond core).
- Run `traceroute 10.0.0.4` from PE1 to confirm traffic is flowing through the tunnel. Hop 1 will show the first physical router on the tunnel path (P1's interface address) with an `[MPLS: Label]` annotation — that annotation is the evidence the packet was MPLS-encapsulated by the tunnel. Tunnel interfaces are transparent to traceroute; you will not see `Tunnel10` listed as a hop address.
- From CE1, ping 198.51.100.1 sourced from 192.0.2.1 to confirm end-to-end customer reachability is still intact with TE in place.

**Verification:** `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels` must show both tunnels `UP`. `traceroute 10.0.0.4` from PE1 must show `[MPLS: Label ...]` annotated on hop 1 — this confirms the probe was MPLS-encapsulated via the tunnel. The hop 1 address will be the first physical router on the tunnel path (P1), not the tunnel interface name — tunnel interfaces are transparent to traceroute. CE1-to-CE2 ping must succeed 5/5.

## 7. Verification Cheatsheet

### MPLS TE Global Enablement

```
mpls traffic-eng tunnels           ! global (all routers)
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 mpls traffic-eng tunnels          ! per core-facing interface
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels` | List all TE tunnels and their state |
| `show mpls interfaces detail` | Verify TE is enabled on each interface — look for `LSP Tunnel labeling enabled` (IOSv 15.9) |
| `show mpls traffic-eng topology` | View full TE topology database |

> **Exam tip:** `mpls traffic-eng tunnels` must be configured at BOTH the global level AND per interface. Missing either one disables TE on those interfaces — the global command alone is not sufficient.

### IS-IS TE Extensions

```
router isis CORE
 mpls traffic-eng level-2
 mpls traffic-eng router-id Loopback0
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `show mpls traffic-eng topology` | Verify all routers visible in TED |
| `show isis database verbose` | Confirm TE sub-TLVs in IS-IS LSPs |

> **Exam tip:** A router in IS-IS but missing `mpls traffic-eng level-2` is invisible to CSPF. Its links won't appear in the TE topology, so no tunnel can be routed through it.

### RSVP Interface Configuration

```
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip rsvp bandwidth 100000 100000   ! 100 Mbps total / 100 Mbps per-flow
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `show ip rsvp interface` | List RSVP-enabled interfaces and bandwidth |
| `show ip rsvp request` | Show active RSVP PATH states (headend) |
| `show ip rsvp reservation` | Show active RESV states (bandwidth reserved) |
| `show ip rsvp sender` | Show RSVP SENDER_TEMPLATE entries |

> **Exam tip:** RSVP is disabled on all interfaces by default. `ip rsvp bandwidth` is not optional — without it, no tunnel PATH can traverse the interface.

### TE Tunnel Configuration (PE1 headend)

```
! Explicit paths are global config — defined BEFORE the tunnel interface references them
ip explicit-path name PE1-via-P2 enable     ! Task 5: primary path for Tunnel20
 next-address loose 10.0.0.3               ! P2 loopback waypoint
 next-address loose 10.0.0.4               ! PE2 loopback destination
!
! Tunnel10: dynamic CSPF primary, autoroute announces PE2 loopback via the tunnel
interface Tunnel10
 ip unnumbered Loopback0
 tunnel mode mpls traffic-eng
 tunnel destination 10.0.0.4
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng autoroute announce
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng bandwidth 10000   ! TE bandwidth — NOT the interface bandwidth command
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng priority 1 1
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option 10 dynamic
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels tunnel10` | Tunnel state, active path, path-options |
| `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels Tunnel10` | ERO hops, RSVP session details — specifying a single tunnel returns full detail automatically on IOSv |
| `show mpls forwarding-table tunnel 10` | Label forwarding entry for the tunnel |
| `show ip route 10.0.0.4` | Confirm autoroute installed PE2 via tunnel |

> **Exam tip:** `tunnel mpls traffic-eng` and `mpls traffic-eng` are two separate command trees, both available under `(config-if)#`. The `tunnel mpls traffic-eng` tree (bandwidth, path-option, autoroute, priority) is only present on tunnel interfaces. The `mpls traffic-eng` tree (admin-weight, SRLG, attribute-flags) applies to physical links and sets IS-IS TE LSA attributes. Use `tunnel mpls traffic-eng ?` — not `mpls traffic-eng ?` — when configuring tunnel behavior.

### Verification Commands

| Command | What to Look For |
|---------|-----------------|
| `show mpls traffic-eng topology` | All 4 core nodes present; bandwidth > 0 on every core link |
| `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels` | Both tunnels in `UP` / `connected` state |
| `show ip rsvp interface` | All 5 core links (L2–L6, both endpoints) RSVP-enabled at 100,000 kbps |
| `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels detail` | ERO shows expected hops; bandwidth and priority correct |
| `traceroute 10.0.0.4` from PE1 | Hop 1 shows `[MPLS: Label ...]` — confirms the probe was forwarded via the tunnel; the address shown is P1's physical interface (tunnel interfaces are transparent to traceroute) |

### Common RSVP-TE Failure Causes

| Symptom | Likely Cause |
|---------|-------------|
| Tunnel stays `DOWN` after configuration | IS-IS TE extensions missing on a transit router — CSPF has no path |
| Tunnel UP but `show ip route` shows physical interface | `autoroute announce` missing on tunnel |
| Secondary path never comes up | RSVP bandwidth too low on a transit link; CSPF pruned the path |
| P2 not in `show mpls traffic-eng topology` | `mpls traffic-eng level-2` missing under `router isis` on P2 |
| Tunnel goes DOWN after `shut` on transit link | Normal behavior; RSVP tears down and the tunnel reoptimizes if an alternate path is available |
| `show ip rsvp interface` shows interface missing | `ip rsvp bandwidth` not configured on that interface |
| Tunnel stays `DOWN` with `no path options defined` | `tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option` commands are missing — path-options must be added explicitly |
| `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels` shows `Bandwidth: 0 kbps` | `bandwidth` (interface command) was used instead of `tunnel mpls traffic-eng bandwidth` — the TE bandwidth requires the `tunnel mpls traffic-eng` prefix |
| `ip explicit-path` rejected with `Invalid input` | Command entered inside a tunnel interface — `ip explicit-path` is a **global config** command; exit to `(config)#` before entering it |
| `next-address <IP> ?` shows only `<cr>` — `loose` seems missing | The hop-type keyword precedes the address: `next-address loose <IP>`, not `next-address <IP> loose`. Use `next-address ?` before typing the address to see available keywords |
| `tunnel mpls traffic-eng autoroute` / `path-option` not found | Inside the wrong interface — `tunnel mpls traffic-eng` sub-commands only exist on tunnel interfaces (`interface TunnelX`). On physical interfaces, `mpls traffic-eng` shows a different command tree (admin-weight, SRLG) — enter `interface Tunnel10` first |

## 9. Troubleshooting Scenarios

Each ticket simulates a real-world fault. Inject the fault first, then diagnose and fix using only show commands.

### Workflow

```bash
python3 setup_lab.py --host <eve-ng-ip>                                    # reset to known-good
python3 scripts/fault-injection/inject_scenario_01.py --host <eve-ng-ip>   # Ticket 1
python3 scripts/fault-injection/apply_solution.py --host <eve-ng-ip>       # restore between tickets
```

### Ticket 1 — Tunnel20 DOWN After Routine Maintenance

Tunnel20 (explicit path via P2) went down after a maintenance window on PE1. Tunnel10 is unaffected and customer traffic continues to flow. IS-IS adjacencies, LDP sessions, and RSVP interfaces are all fully intact. The operator reports that the change script touched "explicit path policy" on the headend.

**Inject:** `python3 scripts/fault-injection/inject_scenario_01.py --host <eve-ng-ip>`

**Success criteria:** `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels tunnel20` shows `Admin: up  Oper: up  Signalling: connected`. `show ip explicit-paths` on PE1 lists `PATH PE1-via-P2` with two `next-address loose` entries (10.0.0.3 and 10.0.0.4).

<details>
<summary>Click to view Diagnosis Steps</summary>

1. Confirm the symptom: `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels tunnel20` — `Oper: down`, `Path: not valid`, `Signalling: Down`. Path-option 10 is configured as `explicit PE1-via-P2`.
2. Check IS-IS and RSVP — both are intact. The fault is not in the transport or RSVP bandwidth layer. Focus on the explicit path reference itself.
3. Inspect the explicit path definition: `show ip explicit-paths` on PE1 — `PATH PE1-via-P2` is absent from the output. Without this definition, CSPF has no waypoint list to compute from; path-option 10 immediately fails.
4. Confirm: `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels Tunnel20` — the `Active Path Option Parameters` section shows no state (tunnel cannot establish any LSP). Tunnel10 is unaffected because it uses a dynamic path-option with no explicit path reference.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to view Fix</summary>

On PE1 — recreate the explicit path definition:
```bash
ip explicit-path name PE1-via-P2 enable
 next-address loose 10.0.0.3
 next-address loose 10.0.0.4
```

Tunnel20 re-runs CSPF within seconds and re-signals via P2. Verify: `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels Tunnel20` returns `Oper: up  Signalling: connected` and the ERO confirms P2 (10.0.0.3) as a transit hop.
</details>

---

### Ticket 2 — Tunnel20 DOWN After Config Audit

Tunnel20 (explicit path via P2) went down after a config audit pass on PE1. Tunnel10 is unaffected. IS-IS adjacencies, LDP sessions, and the explicit path definition (`show ip explicit-paths` lists `PE1-via-P2`) are all intact. The engineer who ran the audit says they "only removed redundant tunnel interface commands."

**Inject:** `python3 scripts/fault-injection/inject_scenario_02.py --host <eve-ng-ip>`

**Success criteria:** `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels tunnel20` shows `Admin: up  Oper: up  Signalling: connected`. `show running-config interface Tunnel20` confirms `tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option 10 explicit name PE1-via-P2`.

<details>
<summary>Click to view Diagnosis Steps</summary>

1. Confirm the symptom: `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels tunnel20` — `Oper: down`, `Path: not valid`, `Signalling: Down`. The output also reads `no path options defined`.
2. Verify the explicit path definition is intact: `show ip explicit-paths` on PE1 — `PATH PE1-via-P2` is present with both `next-address loose` hops. The path definition itself is not the fault.
3. Inspect the tunnel interface: `show running-config interface Tunnel20` — the `tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option 10 explicit name PE1-via-P2` line is absent. The path definition exists but the tunnel has no path-option referencing it.
4. Root cause: CSPF cannot signal an LSP for Tunnel20 because no path-option is configured. Without a path-option, the headend has no instruction to initiate RSVP-TE signalling.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to view Fix</summary>

On PE1, re-add the path-option to Tunnel20:
```bash
interface Tunnel20
 tunnel mpls traffic-eng path-option 10 explicit name PE1-via-P2
```

CSPF runs immediately and Tunnel20 re-signals via P2. Verify: `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels Tunnel20` returns `Oper: up  Signalling: connected` and the ERO confirms P2 (10.0.0.3) as a transit hop.
</details>

---

### Ticket 3 — Tunnel10 Down After PE1 Optimization Push

Tunnel10 (dynamic path) went down after an engineer pushed a "path optimization" change to PE1. Tunnel20 (explicit path via P2) is unaffected. IS-IS adjacencies, LDP sessions, RSVP bandwidth, and the TE topology are all intact. The change description says "added link color constraints to improve path selection."

**Inject:** `python3 scripts/fault-injection/inject_scenario_03.py --host <eve-ng-ip>`

**Success criteria:** `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels tunnel10` shows `Admin: up  Oper: up  Signalling: connected`. `show running-config interface Tunnel10` shows no `tunnel mpls traffic-eng affinity` line.

<details>
<summary>Click to view Diagnosis Steps</summary>

1. Confirm the symptom: `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels tunnel10` — `Oper: down`, `Path: not valid`, `Signalling: Down`. Path-option 10 (dynamic) is configured but failing.
2. Check the TE topology: `show mpls traffic-eng topology` on PE1 — all four nodes are present and all links show 100,000 kbps available. CSPF has a full view of the network.
3. Inspect the tunnel signalling parameters: `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels Tunnel10` — the `Active Path Option Parameters` section shows `Affinity: 0x1/0xFFFF`. This means CSPF requires all selected links to have attribute bit 0 set.
4. Check link affinities: `show mpls traffic-eng link-management interfaces` on PE1 — all core links show `Attribute Flags: 0x00000000`. No link has the required affinity bit, so CSPF eliminates every link and fails to build a path. Tunnel20 is unaffected because it uses an explicit path-option that bypasses affinity-based CSPF filtering.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Click to view Fix</summary>

On PE1, remove the affinity constraint from Tunnel10:
```bash
interface Tunnel10
 no tunnel mpls traffic-eng affinity
```

CSPF immediately retries with no affinity constraint (default `0x0/0x0`). All links become eligible and the dynamic LSP re-signals. Verify: `show mpls traffic-eng tunnels Tunnel10` shows `Oper: up  Signalling: connected` and `Affinity: 0x0/0xFFFF` (or no affinity line in running-config).
</details>
