## Topology Summary

Six-router three-AS provider topology with one optional external peer. AS 65100
is the service-provider core running an internal OSPF IGP; R2, R3 are East PEs
and R5 is the West PE. R4 is the P / Route Reflector. Customer A (AS 65001) is
dual-homed via R2 and R3; external SP peer AS 65002 terminates on R5 via R6.

**Key relationships**

- R1 is dual-homed to R2 (L1) and R3 (L2). Both eBGP sessions are configured
  from lab-00, but lab-02 is where traffic engineering via LOCAL_PREF / MED /
  AS-path prepending makes the two paths diverge.
- R2, R3, R4, R5 all participate in an internal OSPF area 0. iBGP peers on
  loopback0 addresses.
- R4 becomes the Route Reflector in lab-01. R2, R3, R5 become RR clients.
  The direct R2↔R5 iBGP session from lab-00 persists (additive continuity)
  but becomes redundant; a design note discusses production cleanup.
- R5 is a **CSR1000v (IOS-XE)** rather than IOSv. IOS-XE is needed for BGP
  FlowSpec NLRI support in lab-05 and matches real-world SP PEs.
- R7 is optional, activated in lab-05 as a second external peer running
  IOS-XE. It originates flowspec rules and demonstrates eBGP multihop and
  community-tagged prefix exchange.

## Design Decisions

- **XR Coverage Posture: `XR-mixed + appendix`** (per
  `memory/xr-coverage-policy.md`). Foundation/intermediate labs run on
  IOSv + CSR1000v as today; the capstones (lab-07, lab-08) flip 2 IOSv nodes
  to IOS XRv via Phase 3 #5 of the
  [`2026-05-06 XR Coverage Retrofit`](../../tasks/2026-05-06-xr-coverage-retrofit.md),
  and three labs receive workbook XR appendices via Phase 4 of the same
  retrofit: lab-01 (RR on IOS XRv), lab-05 (FlowSpec on XRv 9000 — XRv lacks
  FlowSpec SAFI), and lab-06 (confederations on IOS XRv). Driven by §1.4 and
  §1.5 where XR's `router bgp` neighbor-group / address-family hierarchy is
  the SP production reality and CCIE SP candidates need fluency with both
  dialects. RPL-based filtering on XR is also exercised in the capstone.
- **Mixed platform: IOSv + CSR1000v + IOS XRv (capstone retrofit).** R1–R4,
  R6 are IOSv (IOS 15.9) for resource efficiency. R5 (and optional R7) are
  CSR1000v (IOS-XE) because IOSv does not implement the BGP FlowSpec NLRI
  (SAFI 133); IOS-XE does. This mirrors a real upgrade path where SP West PE
  is refreshed to XE while East PEs still run classic IOS. The capstones
  additionally flip 2 IOSv nodes to IOS XRv per the retrofit; capstone peak
  ≈ 12 GB (4×IOSv + 1×CSR1000v + 2×XRv) — see RAM table in
  `memory/xr-coverage-policy.md` §5.
- **Single confederation lab, tagged `standalone`.** Converting AS 65100 from
  a plain-RR design to a confederation requires re-numbering AS-IDs on every
  SP router — fundamentally a rebuild, not an additive step. Per the
  continuity rules, that work is isolated in lab-06 with a clean-slate
  starting point, slotted just before the capstones.
- **Route-Reflector in lab-01 keeps the legacy R2↔R5 iBGP session.** To honor
  the "only add, never remove" progressive rule, the direct R2↔R5 iBGP peer
  configured in lab-00 persists after R4 becomes the RR. Design notes in the
  workbook will call this out as "legacy / production would remove this after
  RR stabilizes" and the capstone configs start from a clean slate so the
  final design is clean.
- **Single external AS (65002) for most labs; optional AS 65003 for flowspec.**
  Minimizing external-AS count keeps lab-02 through lab-04 focused on intra-AS
  mechanisms. Flowspec needs a second IOS-XE peer to show BGP NLRI exchange
  convincingly, which justifies activating R7 in lab-05.
- **IPv4 only, unicast AFI.** BGP IPv6 / multiprotocol extensions are covered
  by the `ipv6-transition` topic (6PE in 1.6.c) and the `multicast` topic
  (MBGP in 2.2.b). Keeping this topic IPv4-unicast keeps lab time on the
  blueprint bullets that actually belong here.
- **IGP: OSPF area 0.** Any IGP would work for iBGP next-hop reachability;
  OSPF reuses what students configured in the `ospf` topic (same
  interfaces, same subnets on the SP-core links L3/L4/L5/L6).
- **R7 is optional, used only in lab-05 and lab-07.** Keeps foundation and
  intermediate labs on a 6-node footprint, activating the seventh node only
  where flowspec propagation must be observed across two IOS-XE speakers.

## Resource Note

- 5 × IOSv @ 512 MB + 1 × CSR1000v @ 4 GB (+1 × CSR1000v @ 4 GB when R7 is
  active) ≈ 6.5 GB RAM base / 10.5 GB with R7. Within the Dell Latitude 5540
  EVE-NG envelope. If R7's CSR1000v image is unavailable, flowspec can be
  demonstrated with pre-captured outputs in lab-05 — the rest of the lab
  (communities) runs on IOSv alone.
